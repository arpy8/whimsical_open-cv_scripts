# whimsical_open-cv_scripts

A list of playful opencv scripts that you can have fun with.

1. [hill_climb_game.py](hill_climb_game.py) : Play hill climb racing with hand gestures. This script is a shorter version of [this](https://github.com/arpy8/Hand_Gesture_Control) repository. 
2. [reel_scroller.py](reel_scroller.py) : Oh, this one's interesting. Sit back and scroll those youtube shorts with gestures. (don't doom scroll tho). Here's a [demo video](https://youtube.com/shorts/u4QPFFiNli4) 
3. [rock_paper_scissor.py](rock_paper_scissor.py) : This script is an incomplete version of my rock paper scissors game that I'll make later on. For now it just identifies whether you're showing rock, paper or scissors.
4. [gawk_gawk.py](gawk_gawk.py) : I'd rather not tell what this does
